## Projects

### Command Interperter Lab

This project we were tasked with implementing an interpreter for the EEL ("Expression Evaluation Language") in three different layers across three weeks: EEL-0, EEL-1, and EEL-2. 

The first week focused on handling the EEL-0 language that accepts only integer and boolean types, along with some unary, binary, and ternary operators. In the second week, we implemented the EEL-1 language which included all of EEL-0, and also introduced string types, operations, and error handling. In the final week, we added variables to create the EEL-2 language.

This project provided practical experience with explicit memory management using malloc and free calls in C, creating and manipulating pointer-based data structures like trees, linked lists, and hash tables. I also gained hands-on experience with strings and implementing robust code that operates correctly with invalid arguments such as NULL pointers.
